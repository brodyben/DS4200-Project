## Overview for update process:
Stanardized Excel sheet (we define it or should we co-ordinate with Cynthia?)  
Should be admin only  
Web interface for loading excel sheet  
Parse Excel into generic csv or multiple csvs if we want to do some precomputing  
It looks like we will need a server of some sort, even a small one 

## Load all visualizations from custom csvs
Make sure to intellignetly filter based on incomplete data  
Give basic options for how to deal with incomplete data, dispaly as NA, or omit elements missing certain kinds of data
